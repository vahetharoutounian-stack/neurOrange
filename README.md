Drop-in package. Replace `assets/paintings/*.png` with your images and `assets/placeholder.mp4` with your clip.

- Inner ring uses **FOOD** palette; outer ring is **Ghosts-first**; separators are **transparent**.
- Mid nodes hit the left/right phone borders; images remain upright while the ring spins.
- Emoji rings are **orange-only**, no borders, fixed offset from outer ring, CCW spin (upright).
- Center text is “What’chu / Feelin’?” — breathes and tint-pulses, rotates then reverses.
